Git is a control system that helps developers track changes. Github is a service that makes it easier to collaborate on code.
I am now branching in Git, this allows developers to work on separate things independently.
Pull Requests in GitHub:
- A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another.
- It allows code review and discussion before merging.
- It helps maintain clean and controlled collaboration.
